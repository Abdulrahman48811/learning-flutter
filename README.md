# learning-flutter

## Notes
- ui toolkit from google for building natively complied mobile apps & desktop
- lets us build both ios & android on one code base
- it is also cross platform
- super duper fast!
- we use DART as the language
- dart is OOP
- similar to JS with elements of JAVA
- widget (everything is a widget)
- uses material design
- STATELESS WIDGETS - immutable state can not be changed during runtime
- STATEFUL WIDGETS - mutable state can be redrawn multiple times(on screen)
